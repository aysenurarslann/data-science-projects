# Data Science Practice Projects

This repository contains a series of educational Python projects focused on real-world data science tasks. Each file demonstrates a different aspect of the data science workflow ‚Äî from data cleaning and visualization to feature engineering, classification, regression, and natural language processing.

All projects use publicly available datasets and standard Python libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

| File | Topic | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `titanic_analysis.py` | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Basic to advanced analysis of the Titanic dataset using pandas and visualization. |
| `data_cleaning_and_encoding.py` | Data Preprocessing | Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and outlier treatment. |
| `titanic_visualization.py` | Data Visualization | Creating histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and interactive plots with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. |
| `feature_engineering_titanic.py` | Feature Engineering | Deriving new features (e.g., family size, age groups), extracting titles from names, and estimating gender. |
| `unsupervised_anomaly_detection.py` | Unsupervised Learning | Detecting network anomalies using DBSCAN and Isolation Forest on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. |
| `pokemon_classification.py` | Supervised Learning (Classification) | Comparing multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.) to predict legendary Pok√©mon. |
